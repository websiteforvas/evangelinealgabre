summary: I'm beginning new adventures.
---


This year marks my 40th year of graduating from college and almost two years after retiring from my fulfilling teaching career. After the endless congratulations, warm wishes and sincere thank-you’s, I’m beginning to find the answer to the biggest question after retirement – “What’s next for me?”

I am thankful for my family and two sweet brats who call me “Lala.” They give me daily doses of hugs, laughter, and almost weekly treats – which means happy hormones for me. I see former students who blurt out, “Tulad ka pa rin ng dati, Ma’am.” Is it a flattering remark or a ruthless verdict?

My simple involvement in our parish makes me happy. I still bond with friends in real time and space, not just virtually. I now have more time to savor playing with my grand kids, learn DSLR photography, plant more greens, experiment with non-conventional dishes, burn calories with Zumba  and walking via YouTube, and travel to places that I search on YouTube.

Through the years, my challenges get bigger and more urgent. I want to remain productive and involved. That’s why I look for jobs that are not age-related but calls for my skills in writing. I enroll in courses to help me land a job as a virtual assistant. I watch webinars and tutorials and attend meet-ups with millennials. I have new freelancing friends. In other words, I retool myself in varied ways. I do SEO writing, blogs, product reviews, even ghostwriting books for my clients. Life always offers me pleasant options

As a newbie in freelance writing, I continue polishing my craft by actual writing and not just by reading on how to write. I am enriched with my interaction with my entrepreneur clients and energetic colleagues. I can proudly say that I efficiently use some productivity tools (which I could have used in my previous work). I manage my FB page. Yes, I did some blogs in Multiply, a dominant social working platform that ceased in 2012.


I still do daily reflection or discernment, as the Jesuits call it. After all, they were my mentors for more than two decades. What’s next for me now? The next move is always mine. My retirement led me to the retooling of myself and doing more self-reflection. It may lead to my renascence, my fourth ‘r’ .

Welcome to my first website. Big thanks goes to Ted Magaoay. :)
